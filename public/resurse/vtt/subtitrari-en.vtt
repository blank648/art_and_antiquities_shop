00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I must confess, I feel a little bit like Little Miss Sunshine after all these wonderful presentations.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I’m standing here on this empty stage. I have no slides, no music, no PowerPoint...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
…and I’m sitting here with my cards with a speech I didn’t memorize.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But in any case, I really hope to inspire you to reflect more on the important role that art has to play...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
…and to do so without images, which is something very, very difficult for someone in my vocation.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
“All art is quite useless,” wrote Oscar Wilde in his preface…

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
…but he added, “we have art in order not to perish from the truth.”

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Today I want to explore why art really matters.
